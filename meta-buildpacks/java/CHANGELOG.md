## [Unreleased]
* Upgraded `heroku/maven` to `1.0.1`
* Upgraded `heroku/jvm` to `1.0.1`
### Breaking
* Remove Gradle support from this meta-buildpack. Gradle support was realized by using a shimmed version of the `heroku/gradle` Heroku buildpack. We decided to strictly separate shimmed buildpacks from proper CNBs. Gradle support will be re-added later, using a native CNB. ([#308](https://github.com/heroku/buildpacks-jvm/pull/308))
